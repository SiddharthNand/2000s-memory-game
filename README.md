## Background 
Chosen game: Memory game. While deciding what game to create, I was listening to a playlist i made years ago, and it sparked the idea of creating a 2000s r&b themed memory game with some of the popular artist of that era.

### Technologies Used
To create this project I used:
    - HTML5
    - CSS 3
    - JavaScript ES2022
I also used Animate.css and https://jdan.github.io/98.css/ to help design and animate some of the css

### Getting Started
    - Click on two boxes to being, if they match youve succesfully selected a pair. If they do not match, they will flip over and you try again. When youve succesfully selected all the pairs, you win!

### Playlist
 https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/2000s-r-b/pl.f9f71ec4c9ca46569c80ca0f80a2d583

### Next Steps
The next steps I want to work on are adding a shuffling feature to the board to make it different each round, and add statistics so the player can try to beat their scores each round!
